django-mailserver
-----------------

Implements mail server for multiple domains that are served by django.
It allows interaction of mail base services (like payment notification from bank) with the django webs.
It also allows to define forwarding address for any other mail so it is not necessary to setup other mail 
service for whole domain if we want just have to redirect mail to another address.

django-mailserver is based on python asyncore library thus is fully asynchronous.

settings
--------
django-mailserver knows where your django based application resides 
so it regularly tries to load mailserver_settings in particular webapp root
(the folder where is the manage.py script).
For syntax of the mailserver_settings module see examples in test_project_root.
Path definitions django-mailserver reads from config module (/etc/django_mailserver_cfg.py
by default or can be overridden by DJANGO_MAILSERVER_CONF_FILE environment variable).
The config module can contain (othewise defauls are used) few definitions.
For detail see settings.py.


common setup
------------
I have default installation of postfix (aptitude install postfix -y) for mail sending 
with little change in config that force it to listen only at localhost.
django-mailserver listens on external interface to be able to receive mail from internet
(sed 's/inet_interfaces = all/inet_interfaces = localhost/g' -i /etc/postfix/main.cf).
It listens on port 8025 to prevent root permissions and port 25 is actually forwarded to the 8025.
